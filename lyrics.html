        What the heart wants, what the heart wants
        What the heart wants, wants, wants, wants
        You got me sippin' on something
        I can't compare to nothing
        I've ever known, I'm hoping
        That after this fever I'll survive
        I know I'm acting a bit crazy
        Strung out, a little bit hazy
        Hand over heart, I'm praying
        That I'm gonna make it out alive
        The bed's getting cold and you're not here
        The future that we hold is so unclear
        But I'm not alive until you call
        And I'll bet the odds against it all
        Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
        You might be right, but I don't care
        There's a million reasons why I should give you up
        But the heart wants what it wants
        The heart wants what it wants
        You got me scattered in pieces
        Shining, like stars and screaming
        Lighting me up like Venus
        But then you disappear and make me wait
        And every second's like torture
        Hello injured, no more so
        Finding a way to let go
        Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
        The bed's getting cold and you're not here
        The future that we hold is so unclear
        But I'm not alive until you call
        And I'll bet the odds against it all
        Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
        You might be right, but I don't care
        There's a million reasons why I should give you up
        But the heart wants what it wants
        The heart wants what it wants
        The heart wants what it wants
        The heart wants what it wants</pre>
